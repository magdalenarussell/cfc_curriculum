# load library/package (REQUIRED for RStudio cloud users)

```{r}
# run me
library(tidyverse)
```

# import data (same as yesterday!)

```{r}
# run me
clinical <- read.csv("data/clinical.csv")
```

# yesterday we used nested commands to execute multiple commands at once 

```{r}
# select patients with Stage IV cancer, then select only the race, ethnicity, and stage columns
race_stage <- select(filter(clinical, ajcc_pathologic_stage == "Stage IV"), race, ethnicity, ajcc_pathologic_stage)
```

# same task as above, but with pipes

```{r}
piped <- clinical %>%
  filter(., ajcc_pathologic_stage == "Stage IV") %>% 
  select(., race, ethnicity, ajcc_pathologic_stage)
```

# extract race, ethnicity, and age at diagnosis from cases born prior to 1930

```{r}
piped2 <- clinical %>%
  filter(year_of_birth < 1930) %>%
  select(race, ethnicity, age_at_diagnosis)

piped3 <- clinical %>%
  select(race, ethnicity, age_at_diagnosis) %>%
  filter(year_of_birth < 1930)
```

# convert days to years

```{r}
clinical_years <- clinical %>%
  mutate(age_at_diagnosis_in_years = age_at_diagnosis / 365)
```

# convert days to year and months at same time, and we don't always need to assign to object

```{r}
clinical %>%
  mutate(age_at_diagnosis_in_years = age_at_diagnosis / 365,
         age_at_diagnosis_in_months = age_at_diagnosis / 30) 
```
