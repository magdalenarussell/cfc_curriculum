All exercises use the clinical object we created in the readings:

```{r}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse) ## if this isn't working, be sure to run the above (uncomment first)

# Load the data
clinical <- read.csv("data/clinical.csv")
```

There is a column “gender” in clinical; its name is not quite accurate. We would like to rename this column. Using mutate(), code a way to correct the column header to the more appropriate name “sex” (hint: we can use the minus sign (-) within select to remove columns). Save the new dataframe as “clinical_corrected”.

```{r}
clinical_corrected <- clinical %>%
  mutate(sex = gender) %>%
  select(-gender)
```

The column pack_years_smoked represents the values “pack years” for each patient. One pack year corresponds to the number of years a person has smoked one pack per day. For example, 2 pack years means a person smoked a pack a day for 2 years. Risk for cancer is particularly high for people with 20 pack years and more. Using pipes, determine the number of patients with at least 20 pack years.

```{r}
clinical %>%
  filter(pack_years_smoked >= 20) %>%
  nrow() #dim() can also be used
```

Answer is 179 patients

Continuing with the above, how many 20 pack year patients are female and have Stage III cancer at the start of the study?

```{r}
clinical %>% 
  filter(pack_years_smoked >= 20) %>% 
  filter(gender == "female") %>% 
  filter(ajcc_pathologic_stage == "Stage III") %>% 
  nrow() #dim() can also be used
```

Answer is 18 patients
