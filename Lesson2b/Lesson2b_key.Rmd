# Using a function: Rounding numbers

```{r}
## [Round 3.14 using the round() function]
round(3.14)
```

What is the answer?
The answer is 3

# Using a function with more arguments

```{r}
## [add the digits parameter to your rounding code above and round to 1 digit]
round(3.14, digits = 1)

```

Now the answer is 3.1

# Getting help with the `round()` function

```{r}
?round
#run me
```

What happened when you ran the above code chunk?

A new pane was brought up containing information about the round function and a description of the arguments it takes

# Using round with complete argument labels

```{r}
# [fill in the values we used above after the equals]
round(x = 3.14, digits = 1) # edit me
```

Did you get the same answer as before? Or different?
Same!


# Switching the order of arguments

```{r}
# [copy your code from the last code chunk and switch the positions of the parameters, such that x = 3.14 is after the parenthesis]
round(digits = 1, x = 3.14)
```

What happened?
Same answer!



# Removing argument labels

```{r}
# [copy your round statement from above and delete the labels]
round(1, 3.14)

```

I got the answer 1...
