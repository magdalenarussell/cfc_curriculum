# Using pre-made functions

## Instructions:

## Use the `?` operator and/or google to figure out what each of the following functions do (and what arguments they can take)
Type in your answers after each of the function names listed here:

abs()
ceiling()
floor()
log()
sqrt()
exp()
toupper()
tolower()
substr()

## Open the "Lesson2a_practice.Rmd" notebook from yesterday. Copy over the code chunk you wrote to introduce yourself. Then, integrate at least three of the functions you just learned about into your code chunk

```{r}
# my code from last time
myname <- "maggie"
fav_color <- false
height_ft <- 5 + 8/12
fav_color <- "green"

# code for this time:
upper_color <- toupper(fav_color)
first_initial <- substr(myname, 1, 1)
rounded_up_height <- ceiling(height_ft)

```
